## Requirement: Implement Application Tests

### Overview
Implement comprehensive tests for the Bankroll Laravel application to ensure reliability, data integrity, and correct functionality across all major features.

### Scope
- Cover backend (PHP/Laravel) and frontend (Blade views) logic
- Focus on critical workflows: import, classification, export, authentication, and theme switching
- Ensure original bank transaction data remains unchanged during all operations

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: For models, services, and utility functions
- **Feature Tests**: For HTTP endpoints, controllers, and user flows
- **Integration Tests**: For workflows involving multiple components (e.g., import + classification)
- **View Tests**: For Blade templates and UI rendering

### Requirements
1. Use Laravel's built-in testing tools (PHPUnit)
2. Place tests in `src/tests/Feature/` and `src/tests/Unit/`
3. Write tests for:
    - Import system (valid/invalid files, column validation)
    - Classification system (category assignment, notes, AJAX updates)
    - Export system (Excel, CSV, PDF, filtered data)
    - Theme system (mode switching, persistence)
    - Authentication (login, registration, access control)
    - Data integrity (original transaction fields are never modified)
4. Seed database with test data using factories/seeders
5. Ensure tests are repeatable and isolated
6. Provide clear error messages for failed assertions

### Acceptance Criteria
- All major features have passing tests
- Tests run with `php artisan test` or `vendor/bin/phpunit`
- No test modifies original transaction data
- Coverage report available (optional)

### References
- See other PRD documents for feature details
- Follow Laravel and project-specific testing guidelines
