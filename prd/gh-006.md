# Task GH-006: Transactions Table Display

## Objective
Create the transactions table component that displays imported transaction data with editable classification fields.

## Requirements

### 1. Table Structure
- Bootstrap 5.3 styled table (table-striped, table-hover recommended)
- Responsive table wrapper (table-responsive)
- Columns (in order):
  - Date (read-only, formatted)
  - Description (read-only)
  - Notes (editable inline or modal)
  - Withdraw (read-only, formatted as currency)
  - Deposit (read-only, formatted as currency)
  - Balance (read-only, formatted as currency)

### 2. Read-Only Fields Display
- Date: Format as user-friendly date (e.g., "Jan 15, 2024")
- Description: Display original bank description, truncate if too long with tooltip
- Withdraw/Deposit/Balance: Format as currency with proper decimal places (e.g., "$1,234.56")
- Visual indication that these fields are read-only (subtle background color or icon)

### 3. Editable Classification Field
- **Notes column**: 
  - Display current category/classification if assigned
  - Editable via dropdown select or inline edit
  - Dropdown populated with categories from categories table
  - Include "None" or blank option
  - Save changes via AJAX without page reload

### 4. Table Behavior
- Sort by date (newest first by default)
- Pagination if more than 50 transactions
- Smooth updates when classification is changed
- Show success/error feedback after save

### 5. Empty State
- If filtered data returns no results, display centered "No Data Available" message
- Style consistently with Bootstrap 5.3

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Table displays all required columns correctly
- [ ] Read-only fields are clearly marked and cannot be edited
- [ ] Currency values formatted properly
- [ ] Notes dropdown shows all categories
- [ ] Classification changes save successfully via AJAX
- [ ] User receives feedback after saving changes
- [ ] Table is responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Pagination works if needed
- [ ] Empty state displays correctly

## Technical Notes
- Use Blade components for reusability
- Format currency with PHP number_format() or Laravel helper
- Use data attributes for transaction IDs in rows
- Validate category selection on backend
- Consider using Bootstrap tooltips for truncated descriptions
- Ensure AJAX updates don't cause page flicker
