# Task GH-008: Export Transactions Feature

## Objective
Implement functionality to export filtered transactions in XLS, CSV, and PDF formats.

## Requirements

### 1. Export UI Component
- Add "Export" dropdown button near filters or table
- Dropdown menu with three options:
  - Export as Excel (.xlsx)
  - Export as CSV (.csv)
  - Export as PDF (.pdf)
- Use Bootstrap dropdown component
- Only enabled when transaction data is displayed

### 2. Export Data Structure
- Include same columns as displayed in table:
  - Date (formatted)
  - Description
  - Notes (category/classification)
  - Withdraw (formatted as currency)
  - Deposit (formatted as currency)
  - Balance (formatted as currency)
- Export only currently filtered transactions (respect bank/year/month filter)
- Maintain sort order from table display

### 3. Excel Export
- Create XLSX file using Laravel Excel
- Include header row with column names
- Format currency columns properly
- Apply basic styling (bold headers, borders)
- Auto-size columns for readability

### 4. CSV Export
- Create CSV file with comma delimiter
- Include header row
- Quote fields containing commas
- Use standard CSV encoding (UTF-8)

- Include:
  - Title: "Bank Transactions - {Bank} {Month} {Year}"
  - Table with all transaction data
  - Proper formatting and alignment
  - Footer with page numbers
- Landscape orientation recommended for table width

### 6. Download Handling
