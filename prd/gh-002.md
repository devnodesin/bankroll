# Task GH-002: Database Schema and Models

## Objective
Create database migrations and Eloquent models for bank transactions and categories.

## Requirements

### 1. Categories Table
- Table name: `categories`
- Fields:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name` (string, unique) - e.g., FUEL, ELECTRIC BILL, GROCERIES, etc.
  - `is_custom` (boolean) - true for user-created categories
  - `timestamps`

### 2. Transactions Table
- Table name: `transactions`
- Fields:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `bank_name` (string) - bank identifier
  - `date` (date) - transaction date
  - `description` (text) - original bank description (read-only)
  - `withdraw` (decimal 10,2, nullable) - withdrawal amount
  - `deposit` (decimal 10,2, nullable) - deposit amount
  - `balance` (decimal 10,2) - account balance after transaction
  - `reference_number` (string, nullable) - bank reference
  - `category_id` (foreign key, nullable) - links to categories
  - `notes` (text, nullable) - user notes/classification
  - `year` (integer) - extracted from date for filtering
  - `month` (integer) - extracted from date for filtering
  - `timestamps`

### 3. Eloquent Models
- Create `Category` model with appropriate relationships
- Create `Transaction` model with:
  - Relationship to Category
  - Accessors for computed fields if needed
  - Mass assignment protection (only allow notes and category_id to be fillable)

### 4. Seeders
- Create seeder for predefined categories:
  - INCOME:SALES
  - EXPENSE: FUEL
  - EXPENSE: ELECTRIC BILL
  - EXPENSE: TRAVEL
  - EXPENSE: HEALTHCARE
  - EXPENSE: ENTERTAINMENT

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migration files created and can run successfully
- [ ] Models created with proper relationships
- [ ] Seeder populates predefined categories
- [ ] Original transaction data fields are protected from mass assignment
- [ ] Foreign key constraints properly set up
- [ ] Database schema matches requirements exactly

## Technical Notes
- Use `decimal` type for monetary values
- Add indexes on commonly queried fields (bank_name, year, month, date)
- Ensure original bank data fields are never modified after import
