# Task GH-005: Home Page Structure and Filters

## Objective
Create the home page with bank/year/month filter dropdowns that load transaction data.

## Requirements

### 1. Home Page Layout
- Route: `/` (protected by auth middleware)
- Extends base layout (`layouts.app`)
- Two main rows:
  - Row 1: Filter section
  - Row 2: Data display section (table or "No Data" message)

### 2. Filter Section (Row 1)
- Three dropdown selects in a horizontal layout:
  - **Bank dropdown**: List of unique banks from transactions table
  - **Year dropdown**: List of years from transaction data (descending order)
  - **Month dropdown**: Months 1-12 with proper labels (January, February, etc.)
- Use Bootstrap form-select styling
- Dropdowns should trigger AJAX request to load filtered data
- Set sensible defaults (current year/month if data exists)

### 3. Controller Logic
- Create HomeController with index method
- Method to get unique banks from database
- Method to get available years from transactions
- AJAX endpoint to fetch filtered transactions
- Return filtered data based on bank, year, month selection

### 4. Data Display Section (Row 2)
- Initially empty or shows default selection
- Updates dynamically when filters change
- Two states:
  - **No Data**: Show centered message "No Data Available" when no transactions match filters
  - **Data Table**: Show transactions table (table structure defined in next task)

### 5. JavaScript for Dynamic Loading
- Listen for changes on any filter dropdown
- Fetch data via AJAX when filters change
- Update Row 2 with returned data or "No Data" message
- Handle loading states gracefully

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Home page displays with proper layout
- [ ] Three filter dropdowns populate with correct data
- [ ] Dropdowns trigger data fetch on change
- [ ] AJAX requests work correctly
- [ ] "No Data" message shows when appropriate
- [ ] Filter selections persist during session
- [ ] Page is responsive and uses Bootstrap 5.3 styling

## Technical Notes
- Use Bootstrap grid system for layout
- Use fetch API or Axios for AJAX calls
- Return JSON from controller for AJAX requests
- Consider adding loading spinner during data fetch
- Validate filter parameters on backend
