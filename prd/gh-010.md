# Task GH-010: Testing, Polish, and Documentation

## Objective
Perform comprehensive testing, polish the user interface, and create end-user documentation.

## Requirements

### 1. Functional Testing
- Test all user flows:
  - Login/logout
  - Import transactions (valid and invalid files)
  - Filter transactions by bank/year/month
  - Classify transactions with categories
  - Add custom categories
  - Delete custom categories
  - Export transactions in all formats
- Test edge cases:

### 3. Error Handling Review
- All forms have proper validation messages
- Failed operations show clear, actionable errors
- Success messages are clear and appropriate
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- File upload errors are informative

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries (add indexes if needed)
- Test with large datasets (1000+ transactions)
- Ensure AJAX calls don't cause lag

- Check CSRF protection on all forms
- Validate all user inputs on backend

  - Configuration requirements
  - Environment setup
  - Running migrations and seeders
  - Default login credentials
- Document code architecture in `docs/architecture.md`
- Add inline code comments where needed

### 8. Final Checks
